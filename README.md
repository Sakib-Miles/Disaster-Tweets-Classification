# Disaster-Tweets-Classification
Natural Language Processing project for predicting Tweets related to disasters on a largely complex dataset utilizing BERT with the help of Hugging Face Transformers.

[This project was my submission for candidacy to a Research Intern position in an Artificial Intelligence lab (result awaiting), so some work has been left as future work as per lab's instructions. Nonetheless, it is quite good work with excellent accuracy and 100% accurate predictions. Much description is not needed here as the notebook itself is well-documented from beginning to end. Feel free to explore!]
